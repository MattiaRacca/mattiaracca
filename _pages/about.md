Hi! I'm Mattia Racca, and I do research in **Human-Robot Interaction**, Interactive Machine Learning, and, more recently, Social Navigation.

I have a PhD from [Aalto University (Finland)](https://www.aalto.fi/en) on the topic of Active Learning Robots, supervised by [Prof. Ville Kyrki](https://irobotics.aalto.fi/).
